# PSoC6_IMU
Sandbox for playing around with a PSoC MCU and the BMX160 9 axis IMU

*[TAKE CARE TO NOTE COMMIT ANYTHING OTHER THAN INTENDED CHANGES]*

## Notes
* Need to figure out the best way to get ms resolution on the sensor data since the sensorTime stuct only yields seconds
* You can do "end of the line" calibration using FOC (Fast Offset Compensation)
